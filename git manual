Expt No: 01
Initialize a new Git repository in a directory. Create a new file and add it to the staging area and commit the changes with an appropriate commit message.
Make your own directory: mkdir "directory name"  (eg: mkdir naveen)
and always first change your working directory to your own created directory
                         cd "directory name" (eg: cd naveen)
1.	create one directory with name myproj1:  mkdir myproj1
2.	go to created directory:  cd myproj1
3.	make directory myproj1 as local repo by initializing 
    new .git repository under myproj1:       git init 
see fig below:   
    


4.	create one file with name new.txt: notepad new.txt
5.	check git status:  git status

                                                                                   new.txt untracked (red color) 
6.	To track and record that file by .git add that file to staging area: 
             git add . or  git add new.txt
7.	check git status:  git status

            See output   (write output in the record) 
Expt No 02:
Create a new branch named "feature-branch." Switch to the "master" branch. 
Merge the "feature-branch" into "master."

You can work for new problems by creating a new branch in your .git directory without affecting your master branch, after solution to the new problem is implemented in new branch, added it to staging area , switch to your master branch and make commit of updated .git.
1.	cd “your directory” (eg: cd naveen)

Expt No 03:
Write the commands to stash your changes, switch branches, and then apply the stashed changes.
git stash is a command to save the changes or updates in a temporary storage stack data structure. We push changes into stack by push operation, whenever if you  want to  remove pushed changes from stack by pop operation.
Situation, sometime you are working for problem to implement wishing messages in “greetings.c”. Say first time you have implemented “greetings.c”  to print “Hello World” message and you have committed. Again you may require opening same file “geetings.c” to implement “Welcome to git lab” and “Good Morning” messages. To update the same file “greetings.c’”  better you plan to create a new branch “feature”  switch to that branch to do updates to “greetings.c” without affecting to your old commits. 



We do this Expt in two ways:
A.	By using git stash (in general)
B.	By using git stash push –m “message” 
A.
1.   cd “your directory”  (eg: cd naveen)
2.  mkdir myproj3
3.  cd myproj3
4.  git init
5.  notepad greetings.c     
              int main()
              {
                      printf(“Hello World\n”);
                     return 0;
              }               (save it , close notpad)
6.  git add . or git add greetings.c
7.  git commit –m “Hello msg impl”
8.  create a new “feature” branch:   git branch feature
9.  Switch to new branch “feature”:    git checkout feature
10. open same greetings.c  file:     notepad greetings.c
                     int main()
                    {
                            printf(“Hello World\n”);
                            printf(“Welcome to git lab”);
                             return 0;
                   }            (save it and close notepad)
11.  Add changes to staging area:   git add . or git add greetings.c
12.  save the changes by stashing:   git stash
13.  Again open same file greetings.c:     notepad greetings.c
                      int main()
                      {
                                printf(“Hello World\n”);
                                printf(“Good Morning\n”);
                               return 0;
                      }                  (save it and close notepad)
14.	Add changes to staging area:   git add . or git add greetings.c
15.	Save the changes by stashing: git stash


                                                                                                                                                  Temporary storage

                                                                                                                        stash@{0}                 (Hello msg impl)
                                                                                                                          stash@(1)             (Hello msg impl)
                            (HEAD                 feature.master)  “Hello msg impl”
16.	 Check to see stash list:        git stash list
17.	Switch to the “master” branch :    git checkout master
18.	Apply the stash changes to “master”:    git stash apply   
       This command applies all stashed changes to master but shows  “changes not staged 
  For commit” and  greetings.c  file modified in red color.  (stack content  not cleared,
   check it by:  git stash list)
19.	Add to staging area:      git add . or git add greetings.c
20.	Commit the changes:    git commit -m “feature updated by welcome and good morn message” 
21.	Clear stack stashes by :    git stash clear
22.	check commit history log:   git log --all  (see output)
B.
         1.   Follow same of method A  from 1 to 11
        2.    point 12, change like this:     git stash push -m “WIP feature updated : welcome msg impl”
        3.   do same as like point 13 and 14
         4.   point 15, change like this:     git stash push -m “WIP feature updated: Good morn msg impl”

Expt No 04:
Clone a remote Git repository to your local machine.
Cloning means getting or downloading remote git repository from github.com server to your local machine.
To create remote git repository at github.com server you must first create PAT (personnel access token).
To create PAT follow these steps:
1.	login to github.com with your registered email-id and password
2.	click on profile account icon in your github home page and choose settings
3.	click on developer settings in left side settings window
4.	Choose personnel access token (classic) in generate new token dropdown window
5.	Give PAT name in the text box and make NO Expiration in dropdown window
6.	Check on check box Repo, workflow, write packages and delete packages
7.	Finally click on generate new token button.
The above steps gives you PAT key , copy the key and save it in a text file under your own directory.
To create repository follow these steps:
1.	Go to your home page in github.com
2.	Click on create repository button
3.	Give  repository name in the text box  ( say : team_project)

The url link ( url is uniform resource locator) of remote git repository is shown below:

https://github.com/your username/team_project.git                           github.com server

 you have  created an empty remote git repository                                                                 

                                                                                                                                                  Memory(Disk)  
This remote git repository is identified by default name : origin
and default branch name for origin(team_project) is main                                                                                                                                                         
Cloning remote git repository to your local machine:
1.	Go to your own directory :     cd  “your directory”      (eg: cd naveen)                                                       
2.	Clone git repository:     git clone “url link of remote git repository”
(eg:  git clone https://github.com/navinaveen-b/team_project.git)
When we clone this,  git says you have cloned an empty remote git repository
3.	List the content of your own directory:      ls

You will see team_project  folder under your own directory

               Updating remote git repository directly in your local machine
1.	Go to cloned team_project folder:      cd team_project
2.	You are working in remote git repository in your local machine. So, your branch name:    “main”
Update remote git repository branch main by creating one file and committing it.
3.	Create one file named new.txt:    notepad  new.txt  (edit it, save it and close notepad)
4.	Add to staging area:     git add . or git add new.txt
5.	Commit changes:       git commit -m “new.txt added”

(Local machine)                                                                              Remote machine (github.com)

                                                                                          (origin)

                                                                        (clone)
                                        
	
                                                                                                    (update)
                               (HEAD            main) “new.txt added”
6.	Connect remote git repository to git:      
                    git remote add origin “url link of remote git repository”
(eg:  git remote add origin https://github.com/navinaveen-b/team_projet.git)
The above command   Error remote origin already exists, because you are working in team_project.git  (igmore the Error)
7.	Update the remote git repository:                                                  Updated remote git repository           
  git push -u origin main                                             (origin)                                                                      

                                                                                         
                                                                                    (HEAD           main)  “new.txt added”
                                        

Expt No 05:
Fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch onto the updated remote branch.
Rebasing means applying all your local repository commits on top of the remote repository branch by doing this we creating new base level of our branch.
First: Assume you have  updated remote git repository team_project.git  accordingly as from  Expt No 04.                 
                                                                                          The updated remote git repository as ahown below 

                                                                                                           Updated remote git repository
                                                                                               (origin)

  
                                                                                                      (HEAD               main) “new.txt added”


Second: you start working in your local git repository and make some commits by adding some files.
Say, hello.c and welcome.c
1.	Go to your own directory: cd “your directory”
(eg: cd naveen)
2.	mkdir  myproj5
3.	cd myproj5
4.	git init
5.	notepad hello.c    (edit it, save it and close notepad)
6.	git add . or git add hello.c
7.	git commit -m “hello.c added”
8.	notepad welcome.c    (edit it, save it and close notepad)
9.	git add . or git add welcome.c
10.	git commit  -m “welcome.c added”
Your local git repository as shown below:





              (local git repository)


(HEAD            master)  “welcome.c added”

                                                   “hello.c added”

Fetch the remote git repository under your local repository
First connect remote git repository to the git
 git  remote add origin “url link of remote git repository”
(eg: git remote add origin https://github.com/navinaveen-b/team_project.git)




                                                                                     ( connect)

Fetch the remote branch:   git fetch origin       (it shows you fetched main identified as origin/main)


Now your local repository have two branches  “master”  and  “origin/main”  is as shown below:



                                                                                                                        (HEAD            main)   “new.txt added “  
                                                                                             ( fetch)   
(HEAD            master)   “welcome.c added”                               
                                                (HEAD        orgin/main)   “new.txt added” 
      “hello.c added”

Rebase your local repository commits on to remote branch
git rebase orgin/main 
check the commit history log : git log --all
After rebasing your branch tree  is as shown below:


(HEAD-master)          “welcome.c added”
                                          “hello.c added)
(HEAD origin/main)    “new.txt added” 

Update the changes to remote git repository:                      (update)
Change your branch “master” to “main”:                                           (HEADmain)          “welcome.c added”
  git  branch –M main                                                                                                                        “hello.c added”
Push the updates: push -u origin main                                                                                     “new.txt added”

Expt No 06:
Write the command to merge "feature-branch" into "master" while providing a custom commit message for the merge.
Whenever you solving new problems in a new branch (feature-branch), 
you may solved printing of 
1.	hello message by creating “hello.c”  and committed  with “feature-branch updated”
2.	welcome message by creating “welcome.c” and committed with “feature-branch updated”
When you merge this “feature-branch” into “master” branch, to make identified in “master” while merging “feature-branch” we want to merge “feature-branch” with custom commit message.
First, start working in “master”
1.	Go to your own directory:    cd “your own directory”    (eg: cd naveen)
2.	mkdir  myproj6
3.	cd myproj6
4.	git init
5.	notepad new.txt    (edit it, save it and close notepad)
6.	git add . or git add new.txt
7.	git commit -m “new.txt added”
second, start working in feature-branch
1.	create new branch “feature-branch”:     git branch feature-branch
2.	Switch to “feature-branch” :                     git checkout feature-branch
3.	notepad  hello.c              (edit it , save it and close notepad)
4.	git add . or git add hello.c
5.	notepad welcome.c         (edit it, save it and close notepad)
6.	git add . or git add welcome.c
7.	git commit -m “feature-branch: updated”
Third, Merge “feature-branch” into “master”  with custom commit message
1.	Switch to master:      git checkout master
2.	Add changes to staging area:      git add .
3.	Commit the changes in “master”  by merging “feature-branch” with custom commit message:
git merge –no-ff  feature-branch -m “feature-branch updated adding hello.c and welcome.c” 
4.	Check commit history log:     git log --all   (see output)



Expt No 07:
Write the command to create a lightweight Git tag named "v1.0" for a commit in your local repository.
Assume you may be implemented some programs for your project. Say, hello.c and welcome.c and committed. Assume you have implemented “welcome.c” by using older compiler version 1.0 using print function like this:     print(“Welcome to Git Lab”); so, welcome.c can be compiled using compiler version 1.0. SO, you to give a tag for the welcome.c commit as :  V1.0.
1.	Go to your own directory:    cd “your own directory”      (eg: cd naveen)
2.	Create project folder:            mkdir myproj7
3.	Move to project folder:         cd myproj7
4.	Initialize git directory:           git init
5.	Create “hello.c” file:               notepad hello.c
                                                                                 int main()
                                                                                 {
                                                                                          printf(“Hello World\n”);
                                                                                   }              (save it and close notepad)
6.	Add “hello.c” to staging area:     git add .   or git add hello.c
7.	Commit the changes:                   git commit -m “hello.c added”
8.	Create “welcome.c” file:              notepad welcome.c
                                                                                   int main()
                                                                                   {
                                                                                            print(“Welcome to Git Lab\n”);
                                                                                    }              (save it and close notepad);
9.	Add “welcome.c” to staging area:      git add .   or   git add welcome.c
10.	Commit the changes:                    git commit  -m “welcome.c added”
11.	Check to see all commit history log:      git log --oneline
      Output shown below:
       91bb7dd (HEAD -> master) welcome.c added
       ec21a6d hello.c added
              (Green  letters shown above are called  ID number for commits)
12.	Now apply tag for commit ID “91bb7dd” as V1.0:     git tag V1.0 91bb7dd
13.	Verify the tag by:         git tag       (see output)
14.	Check to see to which commit tag points to:       git show V1.0     (see output)
                     (output shows all the details of commit)



Expt No 08:
Write the command to cherry-pick a range of commits from "source-branch" to the current branch.
git cherry-pick <start-commit>^..<end-commit>
git cherry-pick command picks range of commits from start commit-id  to end commit-id from one branch to another branch.
 <start-commit> is starting commit-id and <end-commit> is ending commit-id.
Assume, your source branch is "master" and current branch is "feature"
First start working in master
1.	Go to your own directory:      cd “your directory”      (eg: cd naveen)
2.	Create project folder:              mkdir myproj8
3.	Move to project folder:           cd myproj8
4.	Initialize git directory:              git init
5.	Create a file named new.txt:     notepad new.txt    (edit it, save it and close notepad)
6.	Add to staging area:                git add .    or git add new.txt
7.	Commit the changes:              git commit -m “new.txt added”
8.	Check commit history log in “master”:       git log --oneline    (see output)

 output shows as shown below:

34d79df (HEAD -> master) new.txt added
Second create branch “feature”  and start working there
1.	Create “feature” branch:        git branch feature
2.	Switch to “feature” branch:    git checkout feature
3.	Create file named mytext1.txt:      notepad mytext1.txt    (edit it , save it and close notepad)
4.	Add it to staging area:               git add . or git add mytext1.txt
5.	Commit the changes:                 git commit -m “mytext1.txt added”
Repeat 3,4 and 5 to create files mytext2.txt,mytext3.txt,mytext4.txt and mytext5.txt and commit.
6.	Check commit history log in “feature”:      git log --oneline
Output shows as shown below:
               9adbe88 (HEAD -> feature) mytext5.txt added
               78e3fbe mytext4.txt added
 23dbc7a mytext3.txt added                                            (These 5 commits is from “feature”)    
 dbce617 mytext2.txt added
 6647dda mytext1.txt added
 34d79df (master) new.txt added     (This commit is from “master”)


Third switch to “master” and start working there

1.	Switch to “master”:        git checkout master
2.	To cherry-pick range of commits  as shown above in red color from “feature” to “master” branch:
                                           git  cherry-pick dbce617^..78e3fbe
3.	Check now commit history log in “master”:            git log --oneline 

output shows as shown below:

7273594(HEAD -> master) mytext4.txt added
3e1717e mytext3.txt added
8256ff7 mytext2.txt added
34d79df new.txt added

Expt No 09:
Given a commit ID, how would you use Git to view the details of that specific commit, including the author, date, and commit message?
When user committed any changes in the git repository , git records or stores details like
Author : which user as committed . that is user configured to the git 
                 (eg: git config --global  user.name “navinaveen-b”
Date: when was committed 
Commit Message: what commit message is given

By knowing commit-id we can view the above details. All commit-id can be viewed by the commad
   git log –oneline
1.	Go to your own directory:    cd “your directory”     (eg: cd naveen)
2.	Create project folder:            mkdir myproj9
3.	Move to project folder:         cd myproj9
4.	Initialize git repository:            git init
5.	Cerate file “hello.c”:              notepad hello.c      (edit it , save it and close notepad)
6.	Add it to staging area:           git add .    or git add hello.c
7.	Commit the changes:             git commit -m  “hello.c added”
8.	Create file “welcome.c”:        notepad welcome.c      (edit it, save it and close notepad)
9.	Add it to staging area:            git add .  or git add welcome.c
10.	Commit the changes:             git commit -m  “welcome.c added”
11.	Check the commit history log:      git log --oneline

Output shows as shown below:
a7eab84 (HEAD -> master) welcome.c added
db8900c hello.c added
12.	To see the details of commit-id db8900c:      git show db8900c

Output shows as shown below:

Expt No 12:
Write the command to undo the changes introduced by the commit with the ID "abc123".
Sometimes we do implement solutions to several problems in a same implementation file, but solution implemented and committed contain bug/error. We can revert that commit by removing update changes by using   git revert “commit-id” . git revert command removes wrong updates made by commit-id and creates a new commit-id to come back to correct old commit.

Assume you have two problems to print  “Hello World” and “Welcome to Git Lab” messages. First you implemented “Hello World” msg and committed  in a file “hello.c”  by using statement  printf(“Hello World\n”);. Second time you have implemented “Welcome to Git Lab” msg and committed in the same file “hello.c” by using statement   print(“Welcome to Git Lab\n”);. The second update changes and commit contains a bug/error (shown in red color). So we can revert this commit by removing wrong updates and create a new commit to the proper old commit state.

1.	Go to your directory:     cd “your own directory”     (eg: cd naveen)
2.	Create a project folder:     mkdir myproj12
3.	Move to project folder:     cd myproj12
4.	Initialize git repository:      git init
5.	Create a file “hello.c”:        notepad hello.c
                                                           #include<stdio.h>
                                                           int main()
                                                            {
                                                                   printf(“Hello World\n”);
                                                                   return 0;
                                                             }                (save it and close notepad)
6.	Add it to staging area:            git add .    or   git add hello.c
7.	Commit the changes:              git commit -m “hello.c:   “hello msg impl”
8.	Open same file “hello.c” and update:        notepad hello.c
                                                                          #include<stdio.h>
                                                                          int main()
                                                                         {
                                                                                printf(“Hello World\n”);
                                                                                print(“Welcome to Git Lab\n”);
                                                                                return 0;
                                                                          }                (save it and close notepad)
                                 (updates shown in red color)
9.	Add it to staging area:                   git add .     or   git add hello.c
10.	Commit the updated changes:        git commit -m “hello.c: Welcome msg impl”
11.	Check the commit history log:          git log --oneline 
Output shows as shown below:
3631796 (HEAD -> master) hello.c Welcome msg impl
0232b4f hello.c Hello msg impl
  
The commit-id shown in bold contain error/bug , So we want to remove the update changes and revert back to old commit for proper state.
12.	To revert the commit “3631796”:      git revert 3631796

This command opens “hello.c” file in notepad and asks for enter revert commit message. Just do save the file and close notepad
13.	Check finally commit history log:       git log --oneline 

Output shows as shown below:
8506b19 (HEAD -> master) Revert "hello.c Welcome msg impl"
3631796 hello.c Welcome msg impl
0232b4f hello.c Hello msg impl(New coomit-id  “8506b19” in green color proper commit state removing updates of “3631796”)

14.	Check by opening “hello.c” file:          notepad hello.c
                                                       (you can see the line print(“Welcome to Git Lab\n”)   is removed)
